# Project Reflection: Weather API Dashboard

## Documentation

### Core Concepts Applied
1. **RESTful API Consumption**  
   - Integrated two distinct APIs (OpenWeatherMap + JSONPlaceholder)
   - Implemented all CRUD operations

2. **State Management**  
   - Maintained local state for saved locations
   - Synchronized UI with API responses

3. **Error Handling**  
   - Network error fallbacks
   - User-friendly validation messages

4. **UI/UX Patterns**  
   - Tabbed interface for different operations
   - Progress indicators during API calls

## Reflection

### Key Learnings
- API response structures vary significantly
- Mock backends accelerate frontend development
- Vanilla JS can be surprisingly powerful

### Challenges Faced

1. **API Response Parsing**  
   Weather data structure differed from documentation. Solved by:
   - Adding null checks
   - Implementing defensive programming

2. **State Synchronization**  
   UI updates lagged behind API responses. Fixed by:
   - Optimizing render cycles
   - Adding loading states

3. **CORS Limitations**    
   Workaround: Used JSONPlaceholder as mock backend

### Solutions Implemented
- Created API response normalizer
- Implemented localStorage fallback
- Added comprehensive debug mode
